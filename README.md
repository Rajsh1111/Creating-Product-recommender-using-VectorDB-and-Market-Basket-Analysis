# Creating-Product-recommender-using-VectorDB-and-Market-Basket-Analysis
Our Client is an early-stage e-commerce company selling various products from daily essentials (such as Dairy & vegetables) to high-end electronics and home appliances. It is a one-year-old company and they are witnessing many people coming to their platform and searching for products but only a few end up purchasing.

To increase the number of purchases, the business is planning to use cross-selling  to motivate buyers  to buy more. For this, we were asked to do exploratory data analysis followed by Market basket analysis.
We also created product recommender system which is based on content based recommendations and uses prompts in form of queries from end-user to find closest matching available products. It then suggest the same to the customer.
